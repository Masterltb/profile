### Week 7 Outcomes

- Successfully set up Cloud9 IDE for cloud-based development.
- Configured AWS CLI with multiple profiles for different environments.
- Demonstrated proficiency with EC2, S3, and IAM management via CLI.
- Created automation scripts for routine backup and maintenance tasks.
- Analyzed cost data and identified optimization opportunities.
- Prepared foundation for advanced AWS service exploration.

**Key Learnings:**

- Cloud9 provides browser-based IDE with built-in terminal and IAM integration.
- AWS CLI is faster and more scriptable than console for repeated tasks.
- Multiple profiles enable management of different AWS accounts/environments.
- Automation scripts reduce manual errors and ensure consistent operations.
- Cost analysis enables proactive identification of waste and optimization.
