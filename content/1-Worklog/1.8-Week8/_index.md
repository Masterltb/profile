### Week 8 Outcomes

- Mastered 4 core domains required for AWS SAA-C03 certification.
- Connected OJT hands-on labs (Weeks 2-7) to architecture patterns and exam scenarios.
- Understood AWS Well-Architected Framework: Security, Reliability, Performance Excellence, Cost Optimization.
- Prepared comprehensive exam strategy for 31/10/2025.
- Ready to apply AWS knowledge to real-world architecture decisions.

**Key Learnings:**

- **Security Domain:** IAM roles → least privilege | Encryption (KMS/TLS) → data protection | VPC security → network isolation | MFA → access control
- **Resilience Domain:** Multi-AZ → failover | Auto Scaling → elasticity | Load Balancers → traffic distribution | Route 53 → DNS failover
- **Performance Domain:** Auto Scaling → handle spikes | Lambda → serverless compute | S3/EFS/EBS → storage optimization | Caching → reduced latency
- **Cost Domain:** Reserved Instances → 30-70% savings | Budgets → spending control | Lifecycle policies → storage optimization | Right-sizing → efficient resources
